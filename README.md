## Introduction
This game educates players on how X-ray scanning systems work, challenging them to efficiently distinguish between safe and flagged baggage.  
- Players **lose a life** if they incorrectly remove a safe bag or fail to identify a bag containing prohibited items.  
- The **game difficulty increases** progressively, testing observation skills and decision-making under pressure.  

## Gameplay Mechanics
- **Scan** luggage using an X-ray interface.
- **Identify** prohibited items hidden in baggage.
- **Approve or reject** bags based on their contents.
- **Survive** as long as possible while keeping error rates low.

## Implementation Details
To create authentic visuals:  
- **Real X-ray images** of baggage were collected.  
- These images were processed into **cutouts of flagged and unflagged items** for clear differentiation.  
- The system **dynamically combines elements** to generate varied, realistic baggage scans, enhancing gameplay.
